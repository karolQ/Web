				<h3>London</h3>
				<p>London is the capital city of England.

				London Listeni/ˈlʌndən/ is the capital and most populous city of England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom.[3][4] On the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.[5] London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core,[6] which now forms the county of Greater London[7][8][note 1] governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly,[9][note 2][10] historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire.[11][12][13] </p>

				<h3>Tokyo</h3>
				<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.

				Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō?, "Eastern Capital") (Japanese: [toːkjoː] ( listen), English /ˈtoʊki.oʊ/), officially Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to),[4] is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan,[5] and is both the capital and most populous city of Japan. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.[6] It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.[7] Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).</p>
